      "Dacade is an innovative, open-source peer-to-peer learning platform focused on blockchain technology and decentralized application development. As a fullstack developer and ICP and blockchain project evaluator for Dacade, I contributed to both the platform's technical infrastructure and its educational content. \n\nThe platform offers a unique approach to education by combining collaborative learning, project-based challenges, and cryptocurrency rewards. It provides various `Communities of Practice` centered around different blockchain technologies, as well as AI and blockchain theory. Users can earn while they learn by completing challenges and providing feedback to peers, all while building real projects and engaging with a community of learners and businesses in the blockchain space. \n\n My role involved developing platform features and evaluating submitted projects, particularly those related to Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) and other blockchain technologies. This approach makes learning `multiplayer` and helps users gain practical skills, earn rewards, and build valuable connections in the industry. Working on Dacade allowed me to apply my technical skills while also contributing to the growth of blockchain education and adoption.",

      "Castello Coin ($CAST) is an innovative cryptocurrency project that bridges the gap between traditional art markets and Web3 technologies. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, $CAST is an ERC-20 utility token designed to revolutionize the art market by integrating NFTs, facilitating art events, and providing various utilities such as payments, voting rights, and staking. The platform aims to create a new ecosystem for art enthusiasts, collectors, and investors in the digital age. \n\nAs a frontend developer on this project, my role was crucial in bringing the Web3 vision to life. I integrated Web3 functionality into the frontend, enabling seamless interactions with the Ethereum blockchain for cryptocurrency transactions and smart contract operations. Additionally, I developed a responsive and intuitive user interface that ensures a smooth experience across various devices. The platform allows users to purchase $CAST tokens using credit cards or through crypto exchanges, and participate in NFT drops and art-related events. \n\nThe Castello Coin project emphasizes community building and positions itself as a unique framework connecting Web2 and Web3 technologies in the art world. By blending heritage with innovation, it offers a new paradigm for engaging with art in the digital era. My contribution to this project allowed me to apply advanced frontend development skills in a blockchain context, contributing to a platform that's at the forefront of the art and technology intersection.",
